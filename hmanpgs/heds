NAME
	heds - HotShell Electronic Distribution

SYNOPSIS
	$HOME/HotShell/hcmds/heds <e-mail address>

DESCRIPTION
	heds is an electronic distribution program for the hotshell
	implementation.  heds bundles all of the files and directories
	in $HOME/HotShell, including heds itself and all documentation
	(design document, user guide, etc), using har, and then mails
	this package to the e-mail address specified.  A form letter is
	generated at the beginning of the e-mail which describes how to
	install HotShell as well as where to look for the user guide
	for more information and tutorials after installation.
	Additionally, heds sends a message back to the receiver after
	the addressee has run the installation.  This letter will tell
	the sender if the installation was successful, and if not, it
	will send a message that the installation was unsuccessful.

	Users who have installed HotShell can use heds to forward
	HotShell to anyone they choose, and a message of successful
	completion will be forwarded to the them as well as the
	originator of the software, Harper Langston.


OPERANDS
	The following operand is supported:

	e-mail:  The e-mail address the sender is sending the HotShell
	distribution to.

EXAMPLES
	heds user@cs.nyu.edu - will bundle $HOME/HotShell and send it
	to user@cs.nyu.edu, generating a form letter on how to install
	HotShell.

SEE ALSO
	tar, hstork, har, mail, uuencode, uudecode

NOTES/BUGS
	heds can be run from any directory since the heds script
	changes to $HOME and performs all actions from there.

	Currently, heds can only send successful completion messages
	back to users who are on the same system as the addressee.  For
	example, if user@cs.nyu.edu uses heds to send HotShell to
	user@cs.stanford.edu, user@cs.nyu.edu will not receive a message
	upon installation, but user@cs.nyu.edu will receive a message
	if they send HotShell to user2@cs.nyu.edu or anyone at
	courant.nyu.edu.

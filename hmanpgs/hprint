User Commands:  hprint

NAME
	hprint - will send a job to a specified printer and wait for a
	specified time, and if the job has not become active, it will
	move the job to a new printer.

SYNOPSIS
	$HOME/HotShell/hcmds/hprint [ -a printer ] | [ -d printer ] | [
	printer file [time (in seconds)]]

DESCRIPTION
	hprint will send a file to the specified printer.  If a time is
	given, hprint will wait for that time in seconds, and if the
	job has not become active, it will look for new printers, find
	the smallest queue, and move that job there.  hprint uses the
	file $HOME/HotShell/.hotprinters to look for possible printers;
	the given printer is also searched since it may have the
	smallest queue.  If time is not given, hprint acts like lpr,
	simply putting your job in the queue of the given printer.

	The initial call to hprint must use a printer which is in
	.hotprinters.  If this printer is not in the .hotprinters file,
	an error message will be generated.  However, a printer can
	easily be added to the .hotprinters file by using the command:
	hprint -a printer.  Additionally, a printer can be removed from
	the .hotprinters file by running hprint -d printer.  See
	EXAMPLES below for examples of how each of these commands
	works.

OPTIONS
	The following options are supported:

	-a printer:  Add printer to the .hotprinters file.  If printer
	is already in .hotprinters, it will not be added.

	-d printer:  Delete printer from the .hotprinters file.  If
	printer is not in .hotprinters, it will not be deleted, and an
	error message will be generated.

OPERANDS
	The following operands are supported:

	printer job [ time (in seconds)]:
	send file, job, to printer, and wait for time if specified to
	see if job has become active.  If so, job will be printed at
	printer.  Otherwise, hprint will loop through the .hotprinters
	file, looking for the smallest queue, remove job from the queue
	of printer and place it in the new smallest queue.

EXAMPLES
	hotshell>hprint -a nhp66
	Adding printer nhp66 to your .hotprinters file

	hotshell>hprint -d nhp67
	nhp67 not in .hotprinters.  Cannot delete.

	hotshell>hprint -d nhp66
	Removing nhp66 from .hotprinters

	hotshell>hprint nhp33 test 5
	Printer not in .hotprinters
	To use this printer, type hprint -a printer and try again.

	hotshell>hprint -a nhp33
	Adding nhp33 to your .hotprinters file

	hotshell>hprint nhp33 test 5
	Printing test to printer:  nhp33
	Job test has not printed after 5 seconds at nhp33.
	First removing test from nhp33
	nhp33-988: cancelled
	Searching nhp7 . . .
	Searching nhp15 . . .
	Searching nhp33 . . .
	nhp7 had smallest printer queue
	Now printing to nhp7

FILES
	hprint is dependent on the $HOME/HotShell/.hotprinters file
	which contains a list of user-defined printers.  Each row
	contains one printer, and this file can be edited using the -a
	and -d switches describe above.  To view its contents, type:
	more $HOME/HotShell/.hotprinters

EXIT VALUES
	0 - hprint was successful
	1 - hprint unsuccessful

SEE ALSO
	lpr, lpq, lprm

NOTES/BUGS
	A call to hprint printer job must use a printer in the
	.hotprinters file.  If it is not a valid printer, an error
	message will be generated, describing how to add this printer
	to .hotprinters if desired.

	To view the contents of the .hotprinters file, type cat
	$HOME/HotSHELL/.hotprinters

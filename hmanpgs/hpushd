User Commands: hpushd

NAME
        hpushd - manipulates directory stack
	       
SYNOPSIS
        $HOME/HotShell/hotshell (Built-in command)
	hpushd [+n]
	hpushd [directory]

DESCRIPTION
        hpushd pushes directories onto the directory stack. The
        directory stack allows users to keep track of multiple
        directories and to switch between them easily.
        
        hdirs displays the contents of the directory stack. The top
        of the stack is the leftmost directory.  The '~' represents
        the home directory. Therefore, an entry such as ~/foo would 
        be the same as $HOME/foo.  The top of the stack always
        contains the current working directory. Directories are
        removed from the stack with the hpopd function.      
        
        hpushd with no arguments switches the top two entries on the
        stack. It then changes the current working directory to
        whatever directory is now sitting on top of the stack.
        
        hpushd +n rotates the nth directory to the top of the stack. It 
        then changes the current working directory to new directory.
        Begin counting at 0. Note that n must be one or more. 
        
        hpushd directory pushes directory onto the stack and makes that
        directory the current working directory.
        
OPERANDS
        The following operands are supported:
        
        n  :  hpopdd +n removes the nth directory from the directory
              stack
              
        directory :  pushes that directory onto the stack and makes it
                     the current working directory.
        
EXAMPLES
        hotshell>hdirs                  # display directory stack
        ~/HotShell
        hotshell>pwd
        /home/john123/HotShell
        hotshell>hpushd hcmds           # push hcmds onto the stack
        ~/HotShell/hcmds  ~/HotShell
        hotshell>hpushd                 # switch the top two entries
        ~/HotShell  ~/HotShell/hcmds    # on the stack
        hotshell>hpushd data
        ~/HotShell/data  ~/HotShell  ~/HotShell/hcmds
        hotshell>hpushd +2              # rotate directory 2 onto top
        ~/HotShell/hcmds  ~/HotShell/data  ~/HotShell      # of stack

User Commands:  hbwrite

NAME
	hbwrite - write to multiple users at once

SYNOPSIS
	$HOME/HotShell/hcmds/hbwrite user1 [ user2 . . . usern ] :
	broadcast

DESCRIPTION
	hbwrite allows the user to write a message, broadcast, to
	multiple users' screens at the same time.  hbwrite loops
	through the list of users given and looks for them on the
	current host only and if they are found, sends the message,
	broadcast, to their screen.  If they are not found on the
	current host, hbwrite lets the user know that that specific
	user was not found and continues to loop through the list of
	users.

	It is necessary that the message broadcast not be enclosed by
	"" or '' marks.  Additionally, no punctuation in the message
	should be used (?!%$# etc).

OPERANDS
	The following operands are supported:

	user1 [ user2 . . . usern ] : List of users to send broadcast
	message to.

	broadcast: A message to be broadcast; this message should not
	be enclosed in quotation marks or have any punctuation in it
	such as ! & * %, etc.

EXAMPLES
	hbwrite new_user unixtool : How are you

	Will send the message, How are you, to unixtool and new_user if
	they are logged onto the current local host

SEE ALSO
	write

EXIT VALUES
	0 - hbwrite to all users successful
	1 - hbwrite unsuccessful to all
	2 - hbwrite failed for one or more but not all given users

NOTES/BUGS
	All users to hbwrite to must be on the current local host.

	The message, broadcast, cannot contain any quotation or
	punctuation marks.  For example,
	"How are you"
	is invalid while
	How are you
	is valid

	Another example:
	How are you?
	will fail because of the ? mark

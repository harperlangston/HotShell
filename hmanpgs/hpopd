User Commands: hpopd

NAME
        hpopd - manipulates directory stack
	       
SYNOPSIS
        $HOME/HotShell/hotshell (Built-in command)
	hpopd [+n]

DESCRIPTION
        hpopd removes directories from the directory stack. The
        directory stack allows users to keep track of multiple
        directories and to switch between them easily.
        
        hdirs displays the contents of the directory stack. The 
        top of the stack is the leftmost directory.  The '~' 
        represents the home directory. Therefore, an entry such
        as ~/foo would be the same as $HOME/foo.  The top of the
        stack always contains the current working directory. 
        Directories are added to the stack with the hpushd function.       
        
        hpopd with no arguments removes the top directory from the
        stack. It then changes the current working directory to
        whatever directory is now sitting on top of the stack.
        
        hpopd +n removes the nth directory.  Begin counting at 0.
        Note that n must be one or more.      
        
OPERANDS
        The following operands are supported:
        
        n  :  hpopdd +n removes the nth directory from the directory
              stack
        
EXAMPLES
        hotshell>hdirs                  # display directory stack
        ~/HotShell
        hotshell>pwd
        /home/john123/HotShell
        hotshell>hpushd hcmds           # push hcmds onto the stack
        ~/HotShell/hcmds  ~/HotShell
        hotshell>hpopd +1               # remove 1st dir. from stack
        ~/HotShell                      # counting from 0

User Commands:  hcgrep

NAME
	hcgrep - a context grep which takes a directory

SYNOPSIS
	$HOME/HotShell/hcmds/hcgrep pattern directory

DESCRIPTION
	hcgrep is a context-based grep which is given a pattern and a
	directory.  hcgrep searches the given directory and its
	subdirectories for the pattern in all of the directory's and
	its subdirectories' files.  If a file contains that pattern,
	hcgrep returns up to two lines above where the pattern was
	found and up to two lines below.  If the match is at the top or
	bottom of the file, then either one or no lines above or below
	will be returned.

OPERANDS
	The following operands are supported:

	pattern:  The pattern the user is interested in looking for

	directory:  The directory where we are looking for the
	pattern.  hcgrep will search all files in this directory for
	pattern as well as all subdirectories.

EXAMPLES
	The following is an example session using hcgrep.  First, we
	create a test file and then hcgrep for a pattern to show sample
	output:

	hotshell>ls -l > test
	hotshell>echo monkey >> test
	hotshell>date >> test
	hotshell>echo "I like soup!" >> test
	hotshell>
	hotshell>hcgrep monkey ./

NOTES/BUGS

	the pattern was found along with the matched context lines.

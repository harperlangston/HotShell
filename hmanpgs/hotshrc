User Commands:  hotshrc    

NAME
	hotshrc - reloads the .hotshrc file
        
SYNOPSIS
        $HOME/HotShell/hotshell (Built-in command)
	hotshrc

DESCRIPTION
        The .hotshrc file is used for customization.  It stores aliases, 
        defaults and variables.  It's values are loaded automatically
        once when hotshell is invoked and once for each hotshell
        subshell.  Therefore, if the user were to add new entries to 
        the .hotshrc file, those changes would not be visible to the 
        current hotshell.  In order for the current hotshell to 'see' 
        those changes the .hotshrc file would have to be reloaded.  The 
        hotshrc command reloads the .hotshrc file.

EXAMPLES
        Assume that the .hotshrc file is empty when hotshell is invoked.
        
        hotshell>echo $king
        king: Undefined variable
        hotshell>halias
        No aliases defined
        
        now use a text editor to add the following two lines to the
        .hotshrc file:
        
        $king = elvis
        halias sing echo my teddybear
        
        hotshell>hotshrc                     # load the new values
        hotshell>echo $king
        elvis
        hotshell>sing
        my teddybear

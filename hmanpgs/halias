User Commands: halias

NAME
	halias - allows user to assign a name or 'alias' to a command
	         or group of commands.

SYNOPSIS
        $HOME/HotShell/hotshell (Built-in command)
	halias [name] [definition]
	

DESCRIPTION
        Aliasing is a feature that allows the user to assign a name
        to a command or a sequence of commands. Variable interpolation
        is not performed on the definition.  To use an alias, just type
        it's name at the command line, and it's definition will be 
        executed. To release an alias use the hunalias command.
        
        When halias is invoked without any arguments, all aliases and
        their definitions are listed.
        
        When halias is invoked with one argument, that one argument is
        supposed to be the name of a previously defined alias.  If the
        name is in fact an alias, then it's definition is printed.  If
        it is not the name of an alias, an error message is printed.
        
        When halias is invoked with two or more arguments, the first
        argument is assumed to be the name of a new or previously
        defined alias and the other arguments are collectively regarded
        as the definition. halias calls can be invoked on the command 
        line or placed in the .hotshrc file.
	
OPERANDS
	The following operands are supported:

	name : the name to which the definition will be assigned
	
	definition : a command or group of commands

EXAMPLES
        hotshell>halias
        No aliases defined
        hotshell>halias king echo elvis     # king is the new alias
        hotshell>king
        elvis
        hotshell>halias king
        echo elvis
        hotshell>halias
        king  echo elvis

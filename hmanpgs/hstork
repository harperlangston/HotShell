User Commands:  hstork

NAME
	hstork - bundles up customizations and sends them to e-mail
	address specified

SYNOPSIS
	$HOME/HotShell/hcmds/hstork e-mail address

DESCRIPTION
	hstork bundles up your favorite customizations and mails them
	to e-mail address specified.  Currently, hstork only bundles up
	the user's .netscape/bookmarks.html file, the .addressbook
	file, and everything under HotShell.  See under NOTES for
	reasoning and explanations.

	Once hstork e-mail is called, a bundle will be sent to the
	e-mail address, containing a file which must be detached, made
	executable and run from their $HOME directory. No message is
	sent to the e-mail address other than the attachments, since it
	is assumed that the user receiving the bundle is aware of how it
	should be detached, executed and used.  This is due to the fact
	that usually a user will be using themselves at another e-mail
	address for the addressee.

OPERANDS
	The following operands are supported:

	e-mail address:  The e-mail address the hstork bundle should be
	sent to.

EXAMPLES
	hstork random_email@gmail.com - bundles
	.netscape/bookmarks.html, HotShell/* and .addressbook from
	$HOME, maintains all permissions and mails them to
	random_email@gmail.com

SEE ALSO
	tar, mail, uuencode, uudecode

NOTES/BUGS
	As noted above, hstork currently only bundles the
	.netscape/bookmarks.html file, the .addressbook file and the
	HotShell directory.  It is possible to go into
	HotShell/hcmds/hstork and easily add more directories or files
	to add.  One line is commented out which bundles all .xxx
	files.  The reason for not including these automatically is
	that often there are quite a few that a user may not
	necessarily want.  To allow ALL .xxx files to be shipped,
	remove the # from the front of the line which says: # find
	$HOME -type f -name ".*" -exec tar rvf htmp.tar {} \;

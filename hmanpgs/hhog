User Commands:  hhog

NAME
	hhog - find which non-root user is running the most processes

SYNOPSIS
	$HOME/HotShell/hcmds/hhog [ -w ]

DESCRIPTION
	hhog alerts the user which non-root user is currently running
	the most processes on the current host machine.  It also tells
	the number of processes being run by the user running the most
	processes.

	hhog -w will find the user running the most processes and will
	send a polite message to this user, using mail, asking them to
	quit some of their processes.

OPTIONS
	The following options are supported:

	-w: Using hhog with this option will find the non-root user
	running the most processes and send a polite e-mail message to
	them, asking them to quit some of their processes

EXAMPLES
	%hhog
	new_user is running the most jobs:  27 jobs

	%hhog -w
	Sending mail to new_user

SEE ALSO
	ps, mail

NOTES/BUGS
	hhog only looks at the current sever that the $USER is logged
	into and running hhog from.

	Also, run hhog first and check who the user running the most
	processes is; hhog -w may send a message to an irritable
	professor if you are not careful.

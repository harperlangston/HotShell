User Commands:  hrgrep

NAME
	hrgrep - hrgrep is a recursive grep which searches for a
	pattern recursively under a directory tree

SYNOPSIS
	$HOME/HotShell/hcmds/hrgrep pattern [ directory ]

DESCRIPTION
	hrgrep is a recursive grep which takes a pattern and returns
	every occurrence of that pattern in a directory tree.  A
	specific directory can be given, or if a directory is not given,
	hrgrep will do a recursive grep from the current directory.  If
	the pattern is not found, "No match" is returned.  Otherwise, a
	list of every occurrence is outputted.

OPERANDS
	The following operands are supported:

	pattern:  Pattern user is looking for.

	directory:  directory to do a recursive grep for pattern on.
	If no directory is given, hrgrep runs on the current directory
	from which hrgrep is being called.

EXAMPLES
	The following are examples of how to run hrgrep.  You can run
	them yourself to see sample output:

	hrgrep hr (equivalent to hrgrep hr . )

	hrgrep hr $HOME/bin

EXIT VALUES
	0 - hrgrep successful
	1 - hrgrep unsuccessful

SEE ALSO
	grep, hcgrep, egrep, find

NOTES/BUGS
	Currently, hrgrep returns all lines which matched, but it does
	not return filenames of those files with matched lines.  It is
	good for an initial grep to look for a pattern in a directory
	tree somewhere.

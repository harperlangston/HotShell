NAME
        hsethhistory - reset the size of the .hhistory list
	(default value is 10)
	
SYNOPSIS
        $HOME/HotShell/hotshell (Built-in command)
	hsethhistory value
        (value must be between 1 and 200)

DESCRIPTION
        hsethhistory resets the size of the hhistory list. The  
        default value is 10.  The .hhistory saves commands in a list
        to avoid repetitive typing and to allow the commands to be  
        reused in different ways later. hsetsize calls can be invoked 
        on the command-line or placed in the .hotshrc file.        
        
EXAMPLES
       hotshell>hhistory

           2     echo two two
           3     echo three three three
           4     hhistory
       hotshell>hsethhistory 2        # now, .hhistory will only 
       hotshell>hhistory              # contain the previous two   
           5     hsethhistory 2       # commands entered

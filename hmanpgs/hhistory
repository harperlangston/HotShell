User Commands: hhistory

NAME
	hhistory - manipulates commands stored in the .hhistory file 

SYNOPSIS
        $HOME/HotShell/hotshell (Built-in commands)
	hhistory [number]
        ^pattern^string
        !n:s/pattern/string/
        !n:gs/pattern/string/
        !n
        !!
        
DESCRIPTION
        The hhistory mechanism stores commands in a list in the 
        .hhistory file.  This enables users to avoid repetitive
        typing and also makes the saved commands available for 
        later use in a variety of ways.
        
        hhistory with no arguments simply displays the contents of
        the .hhistory file.  The number of commands that are saved
        can be changed by utilizing the hsethhistory command.  The
        default value is 10.
        
        hhistory can also take one argument in which case it will
        only display up to 'number' previous commands.
        
        The ^pattern^string editing feature allows the user to 
        substitute 'string' for the first instance of 'pattern' found
        in the previous command, and then the modified command is 
        executed.
        
        The !n:s/pattern/string/ editing feature is a more general
        version of the previous utility.  The 'string' is substituted
        for the first instance of 'pattern' in command number n and
        the modified command is executed. Also, !n:gs/pattern/string/
        performs the substitution on all instances of the pattern.
        
        !n will repeat command number n.
        
        !! repeats the previous command.

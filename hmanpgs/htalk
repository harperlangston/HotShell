User Commands:  htalk

NAME
	htalk - talk to another user even if they are logged onto
	another host

SYNOPSIS
	$HOME/HotShell/hcmds/htalk user

DESCRIPTION
	htalk allows a HotShell user to talk to another user even if
	that user is logged onto another host.  htalk uses the
	$HOME/HotShell/.hothosts file to determine which hosts should
	be searched.  First, htalk looks on the current host to see if
	the user is logged in, and if so, requests a talk session,
	using talk.  If they are not, htalk loops through the .hothosts
	file, looking for the user until there are no more hosts to
	search or the user is found.  If the user is found, a talk
	session is requested.  Otherwise, htalk exits and alerts the
	user that the person could not be found.

OPERANDS
	The following operands are supported:

	user:  The user to look for.  This should be the user's
	$LOGNAME or $USER value, according to your system.

EXAMPLES
	In this example, my user name is new_user, and I am on
	quorum7.nyu.edu, trying to chat with csweb who is normally on
	spunky.

FILES
	htalk is dependent on $HOME/HotShell/.hothosts which has the
	same style as /etc/hosts.  To alter this file for your specifc
	needs, go to $HOME/Hotshell and edit .hothosts using your 
	favorite editor.

EXIT VALUES
	0 - htalk successful
	1 - htalk given wrong number of arguments
	2 - user could not be found on any hosts
	3 - .hothosts file does not exist

SEE ALSO
	talk

NOTES/BUGS
	If you are not on the courant/cims system, the .hothosts file
	will have to be edited to look for any host you are interested
	in.  For the correct format, look at $HOME/HotShell/.hothosts
	and follow the format inside.

	Even if your local host is not in the .hothosts file, htalk
	will still first look on your local host and then look in the
	.hothosts file.
